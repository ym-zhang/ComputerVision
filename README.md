# Build Your Own Vision Library! #

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different homework assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed. Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/uwimg
    cd uwimg
    make

and check to see that everything compiles correctly. Then, to get started, open up the `README` for homework 0 in `src/hw0/README.md`, or view it [here](./src/hw0/README.md). Good luck and have fun!
